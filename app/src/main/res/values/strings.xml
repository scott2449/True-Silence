    <string name="description">A simple widget that lets you COMPLETELY silence your android phone. Many manufacturers do not allow this with all volume streams and many other applications will only let you set one at a time. True Silence is the only one tap solution to this problem!</string>
	<string name="widget_placeholder">
	<b>Usage</b>\n\n
	True Silence is a widget, not a traditional application.
	The icon you clicked will just bring you to this help screen.\n\n 
	To use True silence: press and hold on any home screen,
	select widgets, and then pick True Silence from the list.\n\n
	You should then see a speaker icon w/ no text appear. 
	Tap it once to silence the phone and again to restore sound.</string>
